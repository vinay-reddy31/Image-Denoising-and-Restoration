# Image Denoising and Restoration using Traditional Methods CNN 

This repository contains the presentation and associated resources from my summer internship project at **National Institute of Technology (NIT) Warangal**. The internship focused on **Image Denoising and Restoration using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Learning Techniques**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project explored advanced image processing techniques to remove noise and restore image quality using deep learning. We compared traditional filters like Median and Gaussian with CNN-based denoising approaches and studied the impact of various types of noise on image quality.

### 🔍 Key Topics Covered

- Basics of Digital Images
- Types of Noise (Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, Speckle)
- Image Degradation Models
- Image Enhancement Techniques
- Denoising using:
  - Median Filter
  - Adaptive Median Filter
  - Gaussian Filter
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Super Resolution Techniques
- Spatial vs Frequency Domain Filtering
- Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)

## 💡 What I Learned

- Understanding different types of noise and their effects on images
- Implementing denoising techniques using both traditional filters and CNNs
- Exploring restoration techniques and super-resolution methods
- Working with CBIR (Content-Based Image Retrieval) systems
- Deep learning-based enhancements and restoration using Python

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- MATLAB (optional for filter design)
- CNN Architectures
